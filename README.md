# Biography
  My name is Houcai Guo. I recieved the B.Sc. degree in Geographic Information Science from Henan University of Economics and Law, Zhengzhou, China in 2020. I am currently persuing the M.Sc. degree in Remote Sensing of Geographical Environment at the School of Geography, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China.<br>
  My current research interests include the registration, spatial-temporal fusion, and time-series analysis of remote sensing images.<br>
  I am a Graduate Student Member of the Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society, IEEE.<br>
